\section{Notes}
The code to generate everything is available online at github at \url{https://github.com/neocpp89/16.930-ps1}.
\begin{itemize}
\item
A couple of notes for the CG/CG+VMS cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For the most parts, the solutions do converge with the correct order (linear and cubic for their respective element types in $L_2$, and one order less in $H_1$).
    \item VMS stabilization doesn't seem to help the cubic at all (and in fact reduces the convergence rate to that of the linear problem).
            This is probably an error in my implementation (particularly in the $\partial_x (\nu \partial_x w)$ term, since this is nonzero for the cubic).
            The VMS stabilization helps the linear problem at first, but the rate is the same, and in fact there is a crossover in error after around 80 elements.
            The difference in that case is minor, however, unlike the cubic problem.
            The plots show that the VMS solution appear to do the correct thing for the linear case with few elements though.
\end{itemize}

\item
A couple of notes for the DG case:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I was not able to get this to work correctly if the problem was not pure diffusion, although it converges to the correct solution after many elements in all cases.
    \item With pure diffusion, the solution is visually indistinguishable from the CG case and errors are similar.
    \item There is probably an issue with the stabilization term (containing the face-lifting operator). If I increase the factor $\eta_f$ drastically (100-1000x), the solution becomes much more CG-like and converges to the exact solution as expected in all cases. I left this out of the current set of plots because it feels like cheating.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
